Description: MethylSurroGetR is an R package designed to facilitate the 
    construction of DNA methylation surrogate biomarker values from existing 
    studies. It provides comprehensive tools for handling missing methylation 
    data through multiple imputation strategies, including mean/median imputation 
    for missing observations and reference-based filling for missing probes. The 
    package supports flexible surrogate calculation with linear, logistic, and 
    Poisson transformations, comprehensive input validation, and detailed 
    diagnostic reporting. Additional utilities include conversion between beta 
    values and M-values, missing data analysis, and vectorized operations for 
    efficient processing of large-scale methylation datasets.
