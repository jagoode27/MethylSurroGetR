# Sample Methylation Data for MethylSurroGetR Package

This file contains sample datasets used in examples and testing for the
MethylSurroGetR package. All datasets are designed to demonstrate
package functionality with realistic but manageable data sizes.

## Methylation Data Matrices

The package includes four methylation data matrices demonstrating
different data scenarios:

- [`beta_matrix_comp`](https://jagoode27.github.io/MethylSurroGetR/reference/beta_matrix_comp.md):

  Complete beta values without missing data

- [`beta_matrix_miss`](https://jagoode27.github.io/MethylSurroGetR/reference/beta_matrix_miss.md):

  Beta values with strategic missing data patterns

- [`mval_matrix_comp`](https://jagoode27.github.io/MethylSurroGetR/reference/mval_matrix_comp.md):

  Complete M-values derived from beta_matrix_comp

- [`mval_matrix_miss`](https://jagoode27.github.io/MethylSurroGetR/reference/mval_matrix_miss.md):

  M-values with missing data derived from beta_matrix_miss
