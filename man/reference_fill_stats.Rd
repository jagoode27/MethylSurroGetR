\title{reference_fill_stats Objects}
\description{
The \code{reference_fill_stats} class stores detailed information about a reference
filling operation performed by \code{\link{reference_fill}}. These objects provide
comprehensive statistics about what was filled and how the missing data was addressed.
}
\section{Object Structure}{

A \code{reference_fill_stats} object is a list with class \code{"reference_fill_stats"}
containing:
\describe{
\item{\code{type}}{Character string indicating the fill type used: \code{"probes"}
(only completely missing probes), \code{"obs"} (only missing observations), or
\code{"all"} (both).}
\item{\code{timestamp}}{POSIXct timestamp of when filling was performed.}
\item{\code{n_total_probes}}{Total number of probes in the methylation matrix.}
\item{\code{n_total_samples}}{Total number of samples in the methylation matrix.}
\item{\code{n_completely_missing_probes_before}}{Number of completely missing probes
before filling.}
\item{\code{n_completely_missing_probes_after}}{Number of completely missing probes
after filling.}
\item{\code{n_probes_filled}}{Number of completely missing probes that were filled.}
\item{\code{n_obs_filled}}{Number of individual missing observations that were filled
(in partially missing probes).}
\item{\code{n_total_values_filled}}{Total number of values filled (sum of probes filled
× samples + individual observations filled).}
\item{\code{n_missing_before}}{Total missing values before filling.}
\item{\code{n_missing_after}}{Total missing values after filling.}
\item{\code{fill_rate}}{Proportion of originally missing values that were filled (0 to 1).}
\item{\code{probes_filled}}{Character vector of CpG probe IDs for completely missing
probes that were filled.}
\item{\code{obs_filled}}{Character vector of CpG probe IDs for probes that had
individual observations filled.}
\item{\code{values_filled_per_probe}}{Named numeric vector showing the number of values
filled for each probe (only present when \code{return_stats = TRUE}).}
\item{\code{probes_not_in_reference}}{Character vector of CpG probe IDs that were
missing but not present in the reference values (only present when applicable).}
}
}

\section{Creating reference_fill_stats Objects}{

Objects are created automatically when calling \code{\link{reference_fill}} with
\code{return_stats = TRUE}:
\preformatted{
# Perform reference filling with statistics
result <- reference_fill(
  my_surro,
  reference = ref_values,
  type = "probes",
  return_stats = TRUE
)

# Access the statistics
stats <- result$reference_fill_stats
}
}

\section{Accessing Information}{

Components can be accessed using standard list notation:
\preformatted{
# View filling summary
stats$n_total_values_filled
stats$fill_rate

# View which probes were filled
stats$probes_filled

# View detailed filling counts
stats$values_filled_per_probe
}
}

\section{Print Method}{

The package provides a \code{print} method that displays a formatted summary:
\preformatted{
print(stats)
}
This shows an organized view of the reference filling operation and its results.
