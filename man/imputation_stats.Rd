\title{imputation_stats Objects}
\description{
The \code{imputation_stats} class stores detailed information about a missing data
imputation operation performed by \code{\link{impute_obs}}. These objects provide
comprehensive statistics about what was imputed, what was skipped, and why.
}
\section{Object Structure}{

An \code{imputation_stats} object is a list with class \code{"imputation_stats"} containing:
\describe{
\item{\code{method}}{Character string indicating the imputation method used
(\code{"mean"} or \code{"median"}).}
\item{\code{min_nonmiss_prop}}{Numeric value (0 to 1) indicating the minimum proportion
of non-missing data required for a probe to be imputed.}
\item{\code{timestamp}}{POSIXct timestamp of when imputation was performed.}
\item{\code{n_total_probes}}{Total number of probes in the methylation matrix.}
\item{\code{n_complete_probes}}{Number of probes with no missing values.}
\item{\code{n_completely_missing_probes}}{Number of probes missing in all samples.}
\item{\code{n_partially_missing_probes}}{Number of probes with some (but not all)
missing values.}
\item{\code{n_probes_imputed}}{Number of probes that had values imputed.}
\item{\code{n_probes_skipped}}{Number of partially missing probes that were skipped
because they didn't meet the \code{min_nonmiss_prop} threshold.}
\item{\code{n_values_imputed}}{Total number of individual missing values that were
imputed.}
\item{\code{n_missing_before_imputation}}{Total missing values before imputation.}
\item{\code{n_missing_after_imputation}}{Total missing values remaining after imputation.}
\item{\code{imputation_rate}}{Proportion of originally missing values that were imputed
(0 to 1).}
\item{\code{probes_imputed}}{Character vector of CpG probe IDs that were imputed.}
\item{\code{probes_skipped}}{Character vector of CpG probe IDs that were skipped.}
\item{\code{values_imputed_per_probe}}{Named numeric vector showing the number of values
imputed for each probe (only present when \code{return_stats = TRUE}).}
\item{\code{skipped_reasons}}{Named character vector explaining why each skipped probe
was not imputed (only present when \code{return_stats = TRUE}).}
}
}

\section{Creating imputation_stats Objects}{

Objects are created automatically when calling \code{\link{impute_obs}} with
\code{return_stats = TRUE}:
\preformatted{
# Perform imputation with statistics
result <- impute_obs(
  my_surro,
  method = "mean",
  min_nonmiss_prop = 0.5,
  return_stats = TRUE
)

# Access the statistics
stats <- result$imputation_stats
}
}

\section{Accessing Information}{

Components can be accessed using standard list notation:
\preformatted{
# View imputation summary
stats$n_values_imputed
stats$imputation_rate

# View which probes were imputed
stats$probes_imputed

# View detailed reasons for skipped probes
stats$skipped_reasons
}
}

\section{Print Method}{

The package provides a \code{print} method that displays a formatted summary:
\preformatted{
print(stats)
}
This shows an organized view of the imputation operation and its results.
