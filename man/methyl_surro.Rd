\description{
The \code{methyl_surro} class is the core data structure in MethylSurroGetR. It stores
methylation data aligned with surrogate weights, ready for calculation of surrogate
predictions. Objects of this class are created by \code{\link{surro_set}} and modified
by \code{\link{reference_fill}} and \code{\link{impute_obs}}.
}
\section{Object Structure}{

A \code{methyl_surro} object is a list with class \code{"methyl_surro"} containing:
\describe{
\item{\code{methyl}}{A numeric matrix with CpG sites as rows (with CpG IDs as row names)
and samples as columns (with sample IDs as column names). Values represent methylation
levels, typically as beta values (0-1 scale) or M-values (log-ratio scale).}
\item{\code{weights}}{A named numeric vector where names are CpG site IDs and values
are the regression coefficients for each probe in the surrogate model. The intercept
term is stored separately (see below).}
\item{\code{intercept}}{A single numeric value representing the intercept term of the
surrogate model, or \code{NULL} if no intercept is included.}
}
}

\section{Creating methyl_surro Objects}{

Objects are created using \code{\link{surro_set}}:
\preformatted{
# Load data
data(beta_matrix_comp)
data(wts_df)

# Create weights vector
wts_vec <- setNames(wts_df$wt_lin, rownames(wts_df))

# Create methyl_surro object
my_surro <- surro_set(
  methyl = beta_matrix_comp,
  weights = wts_vec,
  intercept = "Intercept"
)
}
}

\section{Accessing Components}{

Components can be accessed using standard list notation:
\preformatted{
# Access methylation matrix
methyl_data <- my_surro$methyl

# Access weights
weight_values <- my_surro$weights

# Access intercept
intercept_value <- my_surro$intercept
}
}

\section{Modifying methyl_surro Objects}{

\code{methyl_surro} objects can be modified by:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{reference_fill}}: Fills missing probes and/or observations with
reference values
\item \code{\link{impute_obs}}: Imputes missing observations using mean or median values
}

These functions return modified \code{methyl_surro} objects, optionally with additional
statistics components (see below).
}

\section{Optional Statistics Components}{

When \code{reference_fill} or \code{impute_obs} are called with \code{return_stats = TRUE},
the returned object may contain additional components:
\describe{
\item{\code{reference_fill_stats}}{An object of class \code{reference_fill_stats}
containing detailed information about the reference filling operation (see
\code{\link{reference_fill_stats}}).}
\item{\code{imputation_stats}}{An object of class \code{imputation_stats} containing
detailed information about the imputation operation (see \code{\link{imputation_stats}}).}
}
}

\section{Using methyl_surro Objects}{

Once properly prepared, \code{methyl_surro} objects are used with \code{\link{surro_calc}}
to calculate surrogate predictions:
\preformatted{
# Calculate predictions
predictions <- surro_calc(my_surro, transform = "linear")
}
}

\seealso{
\code{\link{surro_set}} for creating objects,
\code{\link{reference_fill}} and \code{\link{impute_obs}} for handling missing data,
\code{\link{surro_calc}} for calculating predictions,
\code{\link{methyl_miss}} for assessing missing data patterns
}
